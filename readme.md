```shell
pip3 install selenium
```
Java needs to be installed to (i.e. "jre-8u251-windows-x64.exe")

Problem drivers need to be related to the version of the browser that you are using, otherwise it broke the software. It means that this application break every now and then. Better disable update on browsers and decide when and update the related driver at the same time.

error:
When trying to use geckodriver.exe  
`selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: NotFoundError: WindowGlobalParent.getActor: No such JSWindowActor 'MarionetteCommands'`
I have version 84.0.2  
fix:
so I went back to version 82.0.1 with driver geckodriver-v0.26.0-win64 and it starts working again.  
https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/82.0.1/win64/en-US/  

I didn't find a way to disable Google Update, why would that be an easy task?
